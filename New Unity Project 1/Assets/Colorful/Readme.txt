Thanks for buying Colorful !


To use any of the post-processing effects, select a Camera object from the
hierarchy and go to Component -> Colorful. If you're familiar with Photoshop,
Gimp or Paint.Net, you should feel at home.

All these effects require Unity Pro and have been tested on the desktop with
Unity 3.5.2+. Most of them *should* work on mobile too (I can't say anything about
performances though, post-fx are generally quite expensive on these platforms).

If you have any questions of feedback, feel free to contact me on the forum
(look for "Chman"), or drop me a mail to thomas[dot]hourdel[at]gmail[dot]com.
